# Various-Cpp-Projects
Various C++ projects that I have written.


ChatScanner - Useful for online chat servers or MMO games. Scans a sample chat log and a blacklist of words to determine which user is using words deemed inappropriate. Users who do are flagged and the program prompts that they are "banned." (Note: most print statements in this program are either for testing purposes only or are untenable if this program was to be implemented in a larger project. They will be removed when the program is guaranteed to work properly.)

Dijkstra - Take on Dijkstra's algorithm; creates a grid of the user's choice size, asks for a start and end point, generates the shortest path.

PassGen - Generates a random password, with the number of characters based on user input.

SizeFile - Determines the filesize of a given file. Relies on user input for the file's name and directory.
